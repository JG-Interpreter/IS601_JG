For the new Dosa restaurant, I have created a Python script that takes in orders in the JSON format and outputs 2 new JSON files: 

1st file is a customers.json file that contains an object with phone numbers as keys and customers names as values. 

2nd file is named items.json that contains an object with item names as keys and an object with price (key=price, number) and number of times it has been ordered (key=orders, number) as a value
